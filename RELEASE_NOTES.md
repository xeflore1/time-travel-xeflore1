# Features
In this release I have added layout, content, and polish features. 

The layout feature involved two commits, one for creating a file for the magazine, 
and another for filling the file out with a template for the different sections of the magazine.

The content feature also involved two commits, one for filling out the magazine header, and another for filling out the magazine body. 

Finally, the polish feature involved two commits, one for correcting the grammar of the header, and another for improving the flow of the magazine content. 

# Branches

## author/idea-sprint

In this branch I implemented layout and content features using the feature/layout and feature/content branches. 
For each branch after I completed the feature, I merged the feature branch into author/idea-sprint. 
After both features were implemented and merged, I created a PR to merge the author/idea-sprint branch into main. 

## editor/review

In this branch I implemented the polish feature using the feature/polish branch. After I completed the feature I merged the feature branch into editor/review branch.
I then created a PR to merge the editor/review branch back into main.
