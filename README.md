I am learning how to make a magazine (zine) inside a Git repository.

In my .gitignore I am ignoring log/temporary files, built output folders, and os generated files, by doing so I will mitigate clutter in the repository.

author/idea-sprint: This branch will be used to create and write topics for the magazine.

editor/review: This branch will be used to edit and refine the sotries that have been written.
